# WinterHillMux
A list of updated mux settings for the Winter Hill transmitter, intended for use with TVHeadEnd.

## Installation
- Add the file 'uk-WinterHillNew' to the directory containing mux lists.

- By default on LibreELEC this is ~/.kodi/addons/service.tvheadendXX/dvb-scan/dvb-t/
> where "XX" == version number without decimal separator, eg version 4.2 = service.tvheadend42

- By default on Debian (+ derivatives: Raspbian) this is /usr/share/tvheadend/data/dvb-scan/dvb-t/

> You may need to restart TVHeadEnd for the new list to appear in your settings - sudo service tvheadend restart on Debian/Raspbian
