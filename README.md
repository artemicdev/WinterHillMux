# WinterHillMux
A list of updated mux settings for the Winter Hill transmitter, intended for use with TVHeadEnd.

## Installation
- Add the file 'uk-WinterHillNew' to the directory containing mux lists.
- By default (on Debian, other distros may vary) this is /usr/share/tvheadend/data/dvb-scan/dvb-t/
